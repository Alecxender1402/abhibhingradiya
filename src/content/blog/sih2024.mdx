## Meet the Team

The success of this project wouldn't have been possible without my exceptional teammates. Working alongside Rahil, Harsh, and Vishwa was an enriching experience, with each of us bringing unique perspectives to the project.

## Project Overview

Our challenge was to develop an AI-based chatbot for water managementâ€”a solution aimed at promoting sustainable water usage and empowering communities. The chatbot we built offers:

- Real-time water consumption analytics
- Automated water Related queries
- Personalized water conservation recommendations

## Technical Architecture

Our technology stack was carefully chosen to ensure scalability and performance:
- Next.js with TypeScript for robust frontend development
- FastAPI (Python) for efficient backend services
- Supabase with LangSmith for secure data management
- Llama model for predictive analytics and natural language processing
- Cloudinary for media asset management

## Development Process

The 36-hour development cycle presented significant challenges, particularly during the critical integration phase. We encountered notable technical hurdles with our AI integration and Cloudinary implementation, but through systematic problem-solving and effective collaboration, we successfully resolved these issues.

## Final Presentation

During the final presentation, we showcased the chatbotâ€™s ability to analyze live water usage data, detect anomalies, and provide actionable insights. The judges appreciated our end-to-end approach, highlighting the practical impact of our solution on water conservation.

## Future Development

The project is open-source and available for review: [HydraIQ Repository](https://github.com/Alecxender1402/HydraIQv3). We are currently exploring additional features and optimizations to enhance the platform's capabilities.

## Acknowledgments

We extend heartfelt thanks to the SIH organizers, mentors, and all who supported us throughout this journey. Their guidance and encouragement were instrumental in our success.

Participating in SIH 2024 was a transformative experience, reinforcing the importance of teamwork, innovation, and social impact in technology. For anyone considering hackathons, itâ€™s an unparalleled opportunity for growth and learning!
